;;; Commentary:
;; Very simple org babel integration for hurl mode
;; a lot taken from the ob-template


;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)

;; optionally define a file extension for this language
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-lang-exts '("hurl" . "tmp"))

;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:hurl '())

;; This function expands the body of a source code block by doing things like
;; prepending argument definitions to the body, it should be called by the
;; `org-babel-execute:hurl' function below. Variables get concatenated in
;; the `mapconcat' form, therefore to change the formatting you can edit the
;; `format' form.
(defun org-babel-expand-body:hurl (body params &optional processed-params)
  "Expand BODY according to PARAMS, return the expanded body."
  (require 'inf-hurl nil t)
  (let ((vars (org-babel--get-vars (or processed-params (org-babel-process-params params)))))
    (concat
     (mapconcat ;; define any variables
      (lambda (pair)
        (format "%s=%S"
                (car pair) (org-babel-hurl-var-to-hurl (cdr pair))))
      vars "\n")
     "\n" body "\n")))

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;
;; This function will evaluate the body of the source code and
;; return the results as emacs-lisp depending on the value of the
;; :results header argument
;; - output means that the output to STDOUT will be captured and
;;   returned
;; - value means that the value of the last statement in the
;;   source code block will be returned
;;
;; The most common first step in this function is the expansion of the
;; PARAMS argument using `org-babel-process-params'.
;;
;; Please feel free to not implement options which aren't appropriate
;; for your language (e.g. not all languages support interactive
;; "session" evaluation).  Also you are free to define any new header
;; arguments which you feel may be useful -- all header arguments
;; specified by the user will be available in the PARAMS variable.
