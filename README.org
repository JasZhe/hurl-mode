* Acknowledgements
Took a lot of inspiration for the extend region function from [[https://github.com/nex3/haml-mode][haml-mode]]

Also found this example very useful for [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9452615/emacs-is-there-a-clear-example-of-multi-line-font-locking][multi line font locking]]

Another good resource [[https://www.omarpolo.com/post/writing-a-major-mode.html][here]]
